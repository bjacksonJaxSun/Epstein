# Document Takedown Policy

**Last Updated:** February 2026

## Overview

This policy outlines the procedures for requesting removal of documents from this archive. As a repository of public records, we are committed to both transparency and compliance with valid legal processes.

## Scope

This policy applies to all documents hosted on this platform that were obtained through federal court proceedings, FOIA requests, or other official legal channels.

---

## Types of Takedown Requests

### 1. Court-Ordered Removal

**We will comply with:**
- Valid court orders from a court of competent jurisdiction directing removal of specific content
- Judicial seal orders issued after our publication
- Lawful subpoenas requiring modification of hosted content

**Required Documentation:**
- Certified copy of the court order
- Clear identification of specific documents to be removed
- Contact information for verifying counsel

**Response Time:** Within 72 hours of receipt and verification

---

### 2. Informal Removal Requests

**We generally will NOT remove content based on:**
- Informal demands from individuals or their attorneys
- Cease and desist letters without court backing
- Claims that accurate public records are "defamatory"
- Requests based on embarrassment or reputational concerns

**Rationale:** Public records serve the public interest. The First Amendment protects the publication of truthful information from official proceedings.

### 3. Limited Exceptions

We may consider voluntary redaction (not full removal) in narrow circumstances:

| Circumstance | Action Considered |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Minor victims (under 18) | Redact identifying information |
| Witness protection concerns | Review with legal counsel |
| Verified identity theft/SSN exposure | Redact specific PII |
| National security (with government verification) | Review with legal counsel |

**Note:** These exceptions require compelling evidence and are granted at our sole discretion.
