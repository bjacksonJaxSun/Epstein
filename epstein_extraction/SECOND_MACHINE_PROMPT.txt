Copy and paste this into Claude Code on the second machine:

---START PROMPT---

Set up this machine to run distributed OCR. The script and data are on \\BOBBYHOMEEP\EpsteinDownloader.

## 1. Install Tesseract OCR

Download and install from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
(Use Windows 64-bit installer, install to default location C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\)

## 2. Install Python dependencies

```
pip install pytesseract pillow loguru
```

## 3. Run the OCR worker

```
python "\\BOBBYHOMEEP\EpsteinDownloader\epstein_extraction\ocr_worker_remote.py"
```

That's it! The script will:
- Process ODD document IDs (the main machine processes EVEN)
- Read images from the network share
- Update the shared database directly
- Show progress as it runs

---END PROMPT---
