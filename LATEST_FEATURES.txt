   DATASET 9 DOWNLOADER - LATEST FEATURES (Version 3.0)
================================================================================

NEW FEATURE: AUTOMATIC ZIP COMPRESSION
=======================================

The application now AUTOMATICALLY creates zip archives every 1,000 files!

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
1. Downloads PDFs normally
2. After 1,000 files downloaded -> Creates zip automatically
3. Names it: dataset9_batch_0001.zip
4. Deletes the 1,000 original PDFs (after successful zip)
5. Continues downloading next 1,000 files
6. Repeats until all 1.2 million files are done

EXAMPLE:
--------
[1000/1224009] [OK] EFTA00040024.pdf

================================================================================
[ZIP] Creating dataset9_batch_0001.zip with 1000 files...
[ZIP] Progress: 500/1000 files added
[ZIP] Progress: 1000/1000 files added
[ZIP] Created: dataset9_batch_0001.zip (456 MB)
[ZIP] Removing 1000 original files...
[ZIP] Batch 1 complete!
================================================================================
